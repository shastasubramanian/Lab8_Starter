1. 'Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed' because it optimally and automaticly ensures that all tests are passed whenever new code is impelemented in the repository compared to manual checks or at the very end.
2. No. 
3. No. Because the messeging function requires the proper functioning of multiple components and in cooeration with multiple systematic and network level communication. Unit tests cannot capture or test this level of complexity and integration bewteen different functional compartments.
4. Yes. Because this feature can be implemented and tested inside one or few function(s) on a local level and small scale, and does not requires coordination of multiple compartments. In such cases, unit cases will suffice to ensure the proper functioning of this feature.
